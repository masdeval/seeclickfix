\begin_layout Abstract
City maintenance is laborious and expensive.
 One of the main challenges is to monitor unpredictable situations like
 potholes, grafiti, broken footpaths, and so on.
 Once detected, government officials must be able to allocate the resources
 timely and prioritizing the issues most relevant for the citizens.
 The pervasive presence today of mobile internet connection in urban centers
 has enabled modern ways of interaction between the municipality and the
 population, resulting in the so-called Government 2.0.
 One of such way is crowdsourcing platforms, such as See-Click-Fix, FixMyStreet,
 CitySourced, OpenIDEO, and many others, which allow and stimulate collaborative
 participation by reporting urban issues.
 The importance of an issue can be endorsed via votes in the platform, meaning
 that issues with more votes represent the overall felling of the neighborhood
 that those should be solved first.
 This, in turn, constitutes important information to help organizing logistics,
 allocate resources, and fulfill citizens' well-being feeling.
 The problem is that may take time until collecting enough votes to be able
 to estimate the urgency of an issue.
 In this work we propose to estimate the number of votes an issue will receive
 using machine learning techniques.
 As the number of votes is a proxy to the urgency, we hope to improve city
 maintenance by providing in advance sensitive information.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since its rising in early 90s, the World Wide Web has been modifying the
 way people interact.
 Its distributed infrastructure, built upon Internet's top layers, made
 it pervasive and an ideal tool to enable all kinds of communications services.
 On a business perspective, new jargons were created trying to categorize
 such virtual interactions, such as Business-to-Consumer, Business-to-Bussiness,
 and Customer-to-Customer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Social networks are also an example of interaction.
 Facebook, Twitter or Instagram are well known interactive platforms which
 enable users express their opinions.
 Governments have also been experimenting changes in the way the citizens
 interact with them and Kanhere (2011) provides a comprehensive overview.
 The so-called Government 2.0 implies that information should flow not only
 from the government to the citizens but also from citizens to the government
 and among citizens.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
City maintenance is expensive, since it involves monitoring and fixing a
 variety of complex issues related to public safety, environmental problems,
 and quality of life.
 In particular, monitoring unpredictable urban issues (e.g., potholes, damaged
 street signs, graffiti, street light issues, damaged trees) usually requires
 a large number of employees working on a permanent basis.
 However, these same urban centers are full of people armed with their GPS
 enabled cell phones, and represent an important asset to help fine-grained
 monitoring capabilities.
 Civic engagement platforms, such as See-Click-Fix.com, allow citizens to
 report urban issues by entering, for instance, GPS location and free text
 describing the problem.
 Having this information, in turn, helps municipalities to reduce costs
 and improve logistics by better allocating resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important aspect in city maintenance, is how to rank the problems.
 As the resources are limited, most of the time would not be possible to
 fix all the open issues.
 Thus, it is necessary to have a way to measure which ones are more important.
 In the same crowdsourcing platforms, the importance of an issue can be
 endorsed via votes, meaning that the number of votes can act as a proxy
 to the urgency of an issue.
 Therefore, a rank of issues can be built based on those votes.
 While the number of votes an issue receives ultimately reflects its urgency
 to be solved, acquiring a significant number of votes may take several
 days or weeks, leading to ineffectiveness and late responses.
 In order to become more responsive and better meet the needs and concerns
 of the citizens, government officials must be able to prioritize more urgent
 issues as soon as possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, we evaluate machine learning techniques to predict the number
 of votes an issue will receive.
 More specifically, we evaluate Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machine
 (SVM), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms.
 We hope to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, and help to contribute
 in modernizing an important aspect of public administration.
 This wok is organized as follows: next we expose more details about the
 problem and the data, then we describe the experiment and show the results,
 and finally we address our final considerations.

\begin_layout Section
Problem statement and the data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiments use the [SeeClickFix] hackathon data, comprising 34 Mb of
 size and consisting of a total of 223,129 reported issues from four cities:
 Oakland, Richmond, New Haven, and Chicago.
 SeeClickFix.com is a crowdsourcing initiative that allows citizens to report
 issues categorized in 311 different types.
 The main way to submit a request is taking a picture and sending it via
 their mobile app.
 They claim that the service manages the whole work-flow, linking the citizen
 with the city hall.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 1 shows a description of the data.
 There are eleven attributes, being five of them (in bold) used as predictors,
 and 
\emph on
num_votes
\emph default
 as the target variable.
 Notice the high rate of missing value for 
\emph on
tag_type
\emph default
.
 It will be used to produce a baseline model, but not for predictions.
 Figure 1, 2, and 3 show the distribution of the records among issue categories
 (only 24% of the data).

In Figure 1 we can see that issues related to trash, trees and potholes
 correspond to more than 50% of all issues, whereas issues related to lost
 and found items, or to public art, are rarely reported by citizens.
 Issues reported more frequently have higher absolute number of votes.
 But this absolute number is not very useful.
 Figure 2 gives an insight about the urgency of an issue by computing the
 average of votes by category.
 We can see that issues like drug dealing and public concern, although rare,
 receive many votes when occur, revealing the natural concern citizens have
 about them.

One could argue that this order of relevance among issues type would be
 enough as prioritization tool, but typically this is hardly the case.
 Imagine two situations of fallen trees, one on the sidewalk and other on
 the street, blocking the passage.
 It is easy to estimate the high urgency of the second case.
 Even having more and more detailed categories, it is always possible that
 exceptions can occur.
 Thus, ideally, what we would like to evaluate is if a statistical model
 would be able of showing a fine grained distinction between levels of urgency,
 based on the features available in the present setting (of course a platform
 could allow people to check weather a problem is urgent or not, but this
 not the case here).

Finally, Figure 3 shows that more than 70% of the reported issues have only
 one vote.
 For a crowdsourcing platform, this is not very encouraging, and we may
 expect that the data may not be very meaningful since there is that little
 variability in 
\emph on
num_votes
\emph default
.
 This fact may jeopardize our aim of fine grained evaluation since there
 are not examples to learn from.

Another important statistic is the length of the summary and description
 fields.
 This has influence in how to set the parameters of our models and are depicted
 in Table 2.
 The average number of words for summary are 6.4 words, and for description
 are 13 words.

 As evaluation metric we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which evaluates
 how close are

, the predicted and the true value.
 The MSE formula is given by:

 algorithm used, and finally we present the results obtained for Part A
 and B.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Feature Extraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important matter in using supervised learning algorithms is to have
 data in a suitable form to feed them.
 The task of transform the raw data in features is called feature extraction
 and some of the representation techniques we use are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bag-of-words (BOW): This is the most common approach to extract features
 from text.
 The idea is to represent each document as a (sparse) vector where each
 cell counts the number of times a particular word has occurred in the text.
 BOW does not consider the order of words and it is often used with n-gram
 models.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Word Semantic Vectors: word vectors, Word2Vec, word embedding are all designatio
ns of how has been known the recent supervised learning technique to learn
 distributed representation of words 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Mikolov:2013:DRW:2999792.2999959"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The main idea of the skip-gram with negative sampling algorithm is to train
 a two layer neural network to predict the probability of all other words
 in the vocabulary be in the vicinity of this word.
 At the end of the training, the hidden layer will be the word vector because
 one way for the network to output similar context predictions is if the
 word vectors are similar.
 So, if two words have similar contexts, then the network is motivated to
 learn similar word vectors for these two words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transformations we apply on the features are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
prediction and summary: to use with Ridge and SVM, transform to a BOW representa
tion with 5000 words vocabulary size and pruning words that occur in more
 than 50% of the documents.
 To use with LSTM we convert each word in a 200 dimensional word embedding.
 Fill with a blank character whenever it is null.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
date: split in hour, day of week, year, and transform in its one-hot encoding
 representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
location: as they are latitude and longitude values represented as decimal
 degrees, round to three decimal places which corresponds to neighborhood
 precision.
 Apply one-hot encoding conversion.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Follow a brief description of the algorithms we use: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ridge regression: is a variant of the Ordinary Least Square that applies
 a penalty to the loss function in order to prevent from overfitting.
 This is achieved by adding an extra term to the loss that is a squared
 sum of the weights.
 This stimulates the optimization procedure to shrink the weights parameters
 (but not zeroing them).
 It is also known as L2 regularization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support Vector Machines (SVM): is a flexible and powerful algorithm based
 on the idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

large margin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It builds hyperplanes which can be used for classification or regression.
 These hyperplanes are built in such a way to preserve the larger distance
 possible between the samples contained in the two sides being separated.
 This in turn implies in lower generalization error.
 SVM is essentially a linear model.
 However, it can be extended to non-linear boundaries by using different
 kernels which implicitly transform the original features using non linear
 functions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long Short Term Memory: is a class of neural models designed to tackle sequence
 like problems, i.e., problems where past information is relevant to compute
 actual outcomes.
 Among common problems defined as sequential are speech recognition, time
 series analysis, and neural language models.
 LSTM is an improved version of a simpler neural model called Recurrent
 Neural Network (RNN), Figure 4 left of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Jurafsky:2000:SLP:555733"

\end_inset

.
 They share the idea of having a time component, a memory, to enable them
 to take into account history of information.
 LSTM is more robust and complex and is the 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 solution as it allows to process and learn from longer sequences by solving
 many RNN limitations.
 The main drawback of simple RNN is that it uses a single matrix of weights
 (the memory component) to compute actual predictions and also to accumulate
 past information.
 Another problem related to neural models in general is the vanishing or
 exploding gradients, an intrinsic effect associated with the way these
 models learn and that is leveraged in sequence-like problems as the sequences
 trend to be lengthy.
 LSTM tackle these issues using an intricate mechanism of gates to control
 the extent to which a new value flows into a LSTM unit (input gate), the
 extent to which a value remains in the unit (forget gate), and the extent
 to which a value in the unit is used to compute its output (output gate).

\begin_layout Itemize
Bidirectional LSTM: Figure 4 right shows a scheme of a bidirectional RNN.
 In a regular RNN (or LSTM) at each step in time the network learned everything
 about the sequence up to that point.
 We say that the model is taking into account the context in its left.
 For many problems, however, we have access to the entire sequence beforehand.
 It turns out that it is also valuable and possible to keep track of the
 context in the right as well.
 Then, the network can combine both contexts and, as a result, modeling
 a better representation of the data.
 This is accomplished by a bidirectional RNN which process the input sequence
 from the start to the end, and also in reverse, terribly capturing left
 and right contexts into a single representation.
 There are different architectures in which we can use Recurrent Neural
 Networks.
 For our proposal, we are using a Many to One design, which means we have
 as input a sequence and as output a single value.
 This scheme is depicted in Figure 5 (

Experiments and results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we describe the experiment and the result for each one of
 the algorithms experimented.
 The experiment is divided in two parts as we want to assess the feasibility
 of this approach in a more general setting.
 Therefore, Part A addresses only textual features describing the problem.
 We are assuming that a textual description of the issue is common among
 different crowndsourcing platforms.
 In Part B we also use location and date as features, as they are available
 in SeeClickFix.com data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, before we start, as we intend to use linear models to fit the data,
 we first test whether the data has a linear relationship.
 The graphs in Figure 6 show scatter plots of the residuals and the predicted
 values.
 Such graph can be used to detect if the assumption of linearity holds.
 On the left hand side we see the plot over the original data which has
 a R-squared of 0.52.
 The red line is not perfectly aligned what might mean a non-linear relation.
 To correct this, we then apply a log transformation on the target variable.
 The new plot on the right has a better fit and a R-squared of 0.673.

These results suggest that a non-linear transformation of the target variable
 leads to a better linear model, therefore our experiments are conducted
 applying a log-transformation on 
\emph on
num_votes
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Now we present the results for different scenarios.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first set of results, presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

, encompass the whole dataset.
 The table presents, besides the error term, also the R-squared associated
 with the linear models.
 The R-squared, also known as coefficient of determination, is a metric
 applied to linear models that captures the amount of variance of the target
 variable explained by the predictors.
 Thus, for instance, a R-squared of 0.6, means that 60% of the variability
 of Y is explained by X.
 The results seem to be good, with the LSTM model being the winner.
 The MSEs are low and the R-squared are high.
 But recall that the variability of the dataset is tiny.
 Around 72% of the examples have only one vote.
 Thus, if the model only predicts one, it will be right 72% of the time.
 The variance of 
\emph on
num_votes
\emph default
 is 1.52.
 The baseline model here, which predicts the average per neighborhood, has

For the second scenario, we compute the baseline model by predicting the

 Here, the variance of 
\emph on

 is higher (3.41), and the results are much worse.
 Without using 
\emph on

 as predictor, the latent information present is not enough to the evaluated
 models to extract meaningful patterns in order to make an accurate prediction.
 Again, the winner was LSTM but still could not surpass the baseline model.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work we use machine learning to leverage city maintenance capabilities.
 Our hypothesis is that would be possible, with certain degree of accuracy,
 to estimate the number of votes an issue would receive based on their attribute
s.
 The number of votes can be used to estimate urgency and therefore is a
 useful metric to help in planning and prioritization.

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate our hypothesis we employ different machine learning algorithms
 with different properties in an attempt to finding the one that suites
 better to the data and leads to the most accurate prediction.
 This is a common methodology in data analysis since the ground truth function
 which generates the data is missing and our goal is to meet an approximation
 to it.
 We explore four regularized linear models - Ridge and SVM - and a neural
 model designed to handle sequence learning problems, LSTM.
 Linear models are the building blocks of data driven statistical learning
 due their maturity, interpretability and predictive power.
 The model that issued the smallest error was the neural one.
 Neural models are highly flexible and, in this problem, where the main
 feature are sentences in the English language, our choice of LSTM performed
 pretty well.

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings show that the models could not overcome the baseline models
 in both scenarios.
 In the first one, although the error was close to the baseline error, there
 is the issue of the dataset being biased and have only one vote for around
 seventy percent of the records.
 For the second scenario the baseline, besides the neighborhood, also uses
 the category of each problem to compute the predictions.
 The size of the dataset decreases and so the accuracy of the models.
 To mimic the baseline, the models should have to be inferred the category
 from the textual features, which is hard.
 In both cases the models were highly dependent on the availability and
 quality of the textual information and it seems that regression problems
 relying on text is hard.
 Our findings are inconclusive whether or not machine learning can be better
 than simple aggregation and summarization of the data in this setting.
 Maybe a better approach would be to use synthetic data in order to evaluate
 the real feasibility.
