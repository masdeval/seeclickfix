abstract = "In this study, an attempt has been made for making financial decisions such as stock market prediction, to predict the potential prices of a company’s stock and to serve the need of this, Twitter data 1 2 has been considered for scoring the impression that is carried for a particular firm. Streaming data proves to be a perennial source of data analysis collected in real-time. Streaming data basically deals with the continuous flow of data which carries information from sources like websites, mobile phone applications, server logs, social websites, trading floors, etc. The major characteristics of such data being its accessibility and availability, help in proper analysis and prediction of user behavior in a ceaseless manner. The classifying model made out of historical data can be relentlessly honed to give even more accurate results since its outcome is always compared to the next tick of the clock. Spark streaming has been considered for the processing of humongous data and data ingestion tools like Twitter API and Apache Flume have been further implemented for analysis."

        abstract = {Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers organisations and individuals a fast and effective way to monitor the publics' feelings towards them and their competitors. To assess the performance of sentiment analysis methods over Twitter a small set of evaluation datasets have been released in the last few years. In this paper we present an overview of eight publicly available and manually annotated evaluation datasets for Twitter sentiment analysis. Based on this review, we show that a common limitation of most of these datasets, when assessing sentiment analysis at target (entity) level, is the lack of distinctive sentiment annotations among the tweets and the entities contained in them. For example, the tweet "I love iPhone, but I hate iPad" can be annotated with a mixed sentiment label, but the entity iPhone within this tweet should be annotated with a positive sentiment label. Aiming to overcome this limitation, and to complement current evaluation datasets, we present STS-Gold, a new evaluation dataset where tweets and targets (entities) are annotated individually and therefore may present different sentiment labels. This paper also provides a comparative study of the various datasets along several dimensions including: total number of tweets, vocabulary size and sparsity. We also investigate the pair-wise correlation among these dimensions as well as their correlations to the sentiment classification performance on different datasets.}
